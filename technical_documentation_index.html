          <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>

            <hr size="40" noshade>
            <article>
            <p>
              <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
              CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
              From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification.

              Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the ground up — no previous knowledge required.
            </p>
              <h6><strong>CSS first steps</strong>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
              
              <h6><strong>CSS building blocks</strong>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

                <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>
              
              <h6><strong>Styling text</strong>
                <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
              
              <h6><strong>CSS layout</strong>
                <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>

              <h6><strong>Use CSS to solve common problems</strong>
                <p>This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve common problems when creating a web page.</p>

              The CSS layout cookbook aims to bring together recipes for common layout patterns, things you might need to implement in your sites. In addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your projects, these recipes highlight the different ways layout specifications can be used, and the choices you can make as a developer.

        <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
          <header>CSS syntax</header>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>
            <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
            <pre><code>
              h1 {
                  color: red;
                  font-size: 5em;
                }
            </code></pre>
          
          <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (&lt;h1&gt;).</p>

          <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more <strong>declarations</strong>, which take the form of <strong>property</strong> and <strong>value</strong> pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
            
          <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>

          <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>

          <pre><code>
               
              h1 {
                  color: red;
                  font-size: 5em;
                  }
            
               
              p {
                  color: black;
                }

            </code></pre>

          <p> You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find links to all the CSS property pages (along with other CSS features) listed on the MDN CSS reference. Alternatively, you should get used to searching for "mdn css-feature-name" in your favorite search engine whenever you need to find out more information about a CSS feature. For example, try searching for "mdn color" and "mdn font-size"!</p>

          <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
            <article>
              <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.

                Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
            
                To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:</p>
          
              <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&gt;</code></pre>
          
              <p>This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>
        
              <pre><code>
              h1 {
                   color: red;
                }
              </code></pre>

              <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>

              <p>You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>

          <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
            <article>
              <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>

              <pre><code>
                p {
                    color: green;
                  }
              </code></pre>
            
              <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
            
              <pre><code>
                p, li {
                        color: green;
                      }
              </code></pre>
